        q: "Why is content generation slow?",
        a: <TextBlock>Content generation usually takes 10-30 seconds. If slower, check your internet, refresh the page, or simplify your prompt. Complex requests (1500+ words) naturally take longer.</TextBlock>
      },
      {
        q: "I'm getting an error when generating content. What do I do?",

      {
        q: "Why can't I see my uploaded brand documents?",

      },
      {
        q: "Does Madison learn from my feedback?",
        a: <TextBlock>Currently, Madison doesn't automatically learn from single edits, but your brand knowledge compounds as you upload more documents and refine your settings. Adaptive learning is on the 2026 roadmap.</TextBlock>
      },
      {
        q: "Why does generated content sometimes feel generic?",
        a: <TextBlock>This usually means your Brand Health score is low (&lt;70%). Upload more documents, fill in voice details, and add specific product attributes to fix this.</TextBlock>
      },
      {
        q: "Can Madison fact-check information?",
